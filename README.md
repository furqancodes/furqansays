I'm a tech enthusiastic and always learning something new. I graduated as a Software Engineer. Because of my intereset in Web Development I became a fullstack (MERN) developer. I have gained experience in REST APIs with Node.js, building frontend with React and Redux. I have also experience with MongoDB, SQL, PubNub, MailJet and Google APIs.
